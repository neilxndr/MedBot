## Introduction
In this repository, we present a chat bot that demonstrates the capabilities of TensorFlow in the field of natural language processing. The chat bot interacts with users in a human-like manner, responding to text inputs and engaging in meaningful conversations. By combining encoding-decoding techniques and attention mechanisms, the bot can understand and generate coherent responses.

## Features
Interactive Conversations: Engage in dynamic and interactive conversations with the chat bot.<br>
Text Analysis: The chat bot uses advanced text analysis techniques to understand user inputs.<br>
Encoding-Decoding: Utilizes encoding-decoding architecture to generate contextually relevant responses.<br>
Attention Mechanism: Employs attention mechanisms for enhanced response coherence.<br>
Intel oneAPI Integration: Optimized performance on Intel architectures through Intel oneAPI toolkit.<br>

## Techniques Used
The project employs the following techniques to achieve its functionality:

Encoding-Decoding Architecture: <br>
The chat bot utilizes an encoding-decoding architecture to understand user inputs and generate meaningful responses.<br><br>
Attention Mechanism:<br>
Attention mechanisms are used to allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input text, resulting in more contextually relevant responses.<br><br>

## Installation
To set up and run the chat bot locally, follow these steps:<br><br>

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/neilxndr/MedBot<br>
Navigate to the project directory: cd MedBot<br>
Run the python files in the order<br>
-data_lit.py<br>
-train.py<br>
-model-train.py<br>
-encoder.py<br>
-attention.py<br>
-decoder.py<br>
-process.py<br>
Run the Chatbot: python run.py

## Usage
Once the chat bot is up and running, simply start typing your messages. The bot will analyze your input and respond with contextually appropriate answers. Have fun engaging in conversations with the AI-powered chat bot!

### Intel oneAPI Integration
This project leverages the Intel oneAPI toolkit to optimize the performance of the chat bot, particularly on Intel architectures. The integration ensures efficient execution and takes advantage of hardware acceleration for enhanced responsiveness.
